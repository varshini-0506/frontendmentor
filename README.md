### What I learned

While completing the Frontend Mentor recipe page challenge, I learned the importance of using semantic HTML for better readability and accessibility, along with the application of CSS Flexbox for creating responsive layouts.

```html
<section class="prep">
   <h2> Preparation time</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Total:</b> Approximately 10 minutes</li>
      <li><b>Preparation:</b> 5 minutes</li>
      <li><b>Cooking:</b> 5 minutes</li>
    </ul>
</section>
```
```css
main{
    margin: 100px 200px 100px 200px;
    padding: 40px;
    background-color:white;
    border-radius: 10px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction:column;
    justify-content: center;
}

```
